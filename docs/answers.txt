e)	1) If you make a branch, change code, and then realize the code needs to be scrapped. 
If you branch off, you still have the other branch of developement that does not contain your changes.

  	2) If you're collaborating you can make a branch for your own developement. 
Others can make their own changes and not be interrupted by the changes you made until you commit them.

f) git log shows history of commits
git status shows changes since last commit

g) git log -- Weapon.h

h) git log --grep="file"

i) I) Inheritance means a class takes on properties of an existing class. 
The class that is inheriting properties is usually a specific variety of the class it is inheriting from (e.g. class Watermelon inherits from class Fruit)

II) Polymorphism is when a subclass specifies how a method that exists in the superclass works for in its specific case. 
(e.g. subclass circle specificies that the function area in superclass shape returns pi * r * r)

III) Encapsulation means only providing the information that someone needs to know to use a class or function or piece of code.
They don't need to know the specifics of how it works.
